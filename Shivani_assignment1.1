 Problem Statement 1. Please mention true or false for the below statements: a) Prescriptive Analytics is used to predict the 
 future outcomes b) Base R packages are installed automatically 

2.  What is Recycling of elements   in a vector? 
  
3. Give an example of recycling of elements. 

Answers: 
1. a) False (Predictive analytics is used to predict future outcomes.)
b) True.

2. When we apply any operation on two vectors, which are not of same length R automatically repeats elements of shorter vector, 
untill the length og shorter vector is same the long vector. Because to perform any operation on two vectors in R, both the vectors should
be of same length.

3. Example of recycling.
Suppose we have two vectors of different lengths a and b. And we are taking sum of these two vector in vector c.
vector c will be of same length as longer vector a. 
a <- c(1, 4, 3, 6, 8)
b <- c(2, 3)
c<- a+b

o/p is
> c
[1]  3  7  5  9 10

R is repeating the elements of vector of b to make its length same as vector a as follows:

>c
1+2 =3
4+3 =7
3+2 = 5
6+3 = 9
8+2 =10
